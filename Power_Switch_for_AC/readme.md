Window Air Conditioner Script

I am creating an arduino script to control my window air conditioning unit that has a bad motherboard (that is no longer made).  I will be using as many integrated sensors, 
speakers,  and buttons as salvageable.  This is an ongoing project currently.  Updates will be done offline and uploaded here to share on my YouTube channel for anyone with the 
same issue.
